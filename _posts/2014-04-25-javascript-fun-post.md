As usual, I'm here again inside the train and heading to work. Rather than just staring outside and looking at the blurred external surroundings(LOL), I decided to play with some javascript codes playing in my head. Copy+paste the code below into your browser's console. The code is very basic. If you understand loops and arrays, you should be able to understand the code.

### The Beauty of Code Obscurity

{% highlight c %}

_$=[0,2,5,8,11,13,16,19,22,25,28,31,34];_q=String.fromCharCode;_$_$='711111111003210911111411010511010333';___$='';__$=0;_$.forEach(function(_$$$){___$=___$+eval(_q(83)+_q(116)+_q(114)+_q(105)+_q(110)+_q(103)+_q(46)+_q(102)+_q(114)+_q(111)+_q(109)+_q(67)+_q(104)+_q(97)+_q(114)+_q(67)+_q(111)+_q(100)+_q(101))(_$_$.substring(_$[__$],_$[__$+1]));__$=__$+1 });eval(String.fromCharCode(97)+String.fromCharCode(108)+String.fromCharCode(101)+String.fromCharCode(114)+String.fromCharCode(116))(___$)

{% endhighlight %}

Have a great day everyone! Peace!
