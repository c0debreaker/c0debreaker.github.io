As usual, I'm here again inside the train and heading to work. Rather than just staring outside and looking at the blurred external surroundings(LOL), I decided to play with some javascript codes playing in my head. Copy+paste the code below into your browser's console. The code is very basic. If you understand loops and arrays, you should be able to understand the code.

### The Beauty of Code Obscurity

{% highlight c %}

_$=[0,2,5,8,11,13,16,19,22,25,28,31,34];$_=$__=String.fromCharCode;_$_$='711111111003210911111411010511010333';___$='';__$=0;_$.forEach(function(_$$$){___$=___$+eval($_(83)+$_(116)+$_(114)+$_(105)+$_(110)+$_(103)+$_(46)+$_(102)+$_(114)+$_(111)+$_(109)+$_(67)+$_(104)+$_(97)+$_(114)+$_(67)+$_(111)+$_(100)+$_(101))(_$_$.substring(_$[__$],_$[__$+1]));__$=__$+1 });eval($_(97)+$__(108)+$__(101)+$__(114)+$__(116))(___$)

{% endhighlight %}

Have a great day everyone! Peace!
