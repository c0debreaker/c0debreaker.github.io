### The Good

There's no doubt, Philippines has the most beautiful tourist spots in the world! I don't need to say much more about it. Just search it on the internet.

### The Bad, I mean the WORST!!!!!!!

I needed to make this post because I don't want my friends and acquaintances(American, Indian, Japanese, Polish, British, etc) to become the next victim in case you're planning to visit my country. Yes, I'm referring to my own country, Philippines. In fact, I was planning to visit my country in 2017 but decided not to anymore because of the latest crime that is happening right now specifically the Laglag Bala Gang(planting of gun bullets inside passenger's baggages) modus.

I'm extremely shocked as to why these things are happening! There's actually another news prior to this one and it was big in the Philippines. People who work at the customs would examine baggages of passengers but they would also steal stuff they don't own! Filipinos aren't really like this but not sure what's going on! :(

Anyways, that's all I wanted to say!!! :( I'm really sorry!

To all my friends, PLEASE DO NOT VISIT PHILIPPINES FOR NOW! I don't want you to become the next victim.

### Ayaw ko po kayo na maging sunod na biktima sa mga nangyayari ngayon!!!
