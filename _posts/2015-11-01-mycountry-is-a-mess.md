### The Good

There's no doubt, Philippines has the most beautiful tourist spots in the world! I don't need to say much more about it. Just search it on the internet.

### The Bad, I mean the WORST!

I needed to make this post because I don't want you, my friends and acquaintances (American, Indian, Japanese, Polish, British etc) to become the next victim in case you're planning to visit Philippines. Yes, I'm referring to the country where I grew up, Philippines. In fact, I was planning to visit but decided to hold off for now because of the crime that happened recently. Several people got victimized by the Laglag Bala Gang(planting of bullets inside passenger's baggages) modus. These gang members are also believed to be airport employees. They would threaten the victims that if they don't pay, they'll get jailed. Extortion! :( This is extremely sad!

To all my friends, PLEASE DO NOT VISIT PHILIPPINES FOR NOW! I don't want you to become the next victim.

### Ayaw ko po kayo na maging sunod na biktima sa mga nangyayari ngayon!

We're praying that the government will finally put an end to it and act quickly!
