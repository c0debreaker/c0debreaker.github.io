This time, I mean it. I've been studying Assembly Language almost everyday. I stay on my computer until like 2-3am while chatting with hackers from different parts of the world. I did assembly language programming during college but it was inline programming in Turbo Pascal. I used debug.com(not the domain but the executable, LOL) to generate the machine code. It was really fun since I was able to write my own mouse driver. Unfortunately, I landed on a very crappy professor when I took the Assembly Language class. She only taught us how to display alphabet for the whole semester. Maybe it was God's purpose so that I won't do more damage. LOL! Kidding aside.

Anyways, I've started again and this time I am very serious. I've already been studying it for almost 2 weeks now and I have learned tons of things. Didn't know it was easy. I think the reason why I'm saying it's easy is because the document I'm reading was written really well.

Aside from studying assembly language, I've also setup different virtual operating systems that are highly vulnerable. The hackers I chat with everyday also gave me links to war games and capture the flag exercises. They realized I'm a person with good intentions.

See you next time! That's it for now!
