### The Good

There's no doubt, Philippines has the most beautiful tourist spots in the world! I don't need to say much more about it. Just search it on the internet.

### The Bad, I mean the WORST!

I needed to make this post because I don't want you, my friends and acquaintances (Americans, Indians, Japanese, Polish, British etc.) to become the next victim in case you're planning to visit Philippines. Yes, I'm referring to the country where I grew up, Philippines. In fact, I've already made plans on visiting but decided to hold off for now because of the crime that happened recently. It happened many times in the airport.<br/>
<br/>
Several people got victimized by the Laglag Bala Gang's (planting bullets inside passengers' baggages) scam. These people are also believed to be airport security employees. They would even hold passengers (victims) for several days and extorting money to clear their names. If they don't cooperate, they'll be faced with charges. :( This is extremely sad!

PLEASE DO NOT VISIT PHILIPPINES FOR NOW! I don't want you to become the next victim.

### Ayaw ko po kayo na maging sunod na biktima sa mga nangyayari ngayon!

We're praying that the government will finally put an end to it and act quickly!
