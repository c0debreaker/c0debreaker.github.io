            "content": "<p>Fourteen years ago, I wrote a story about a girl.</p>\n<p>I was thirteen at the time, and writing stories was what I did. And not just about girls. Planets that spoke to each other, mice who lived in the Underground, magic meerkats and friendly boats. Writing was my thing; it was beyond a hobby and more than just something I enjoyed. It was how I understood the world. Words had all the magic and possibility anyone could ever need. Put them in the right order, and you could create a world of your own. And maybe, if you got them just right, that world would be a place that would mean something to other people.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d written countless stories by the time I was thirteen &#8211; the first at age 6, in which the acknowledgements page listed all our family pets by name, including the guinea pigs &#8211; of varying length and quality. Each abandoned and finished project was a step closer to Being A Writer; my ultimate goal. My dream. A book on a shelf with my name on it. A book that someone could hold. A book that had a sentence in it that made someone&#8217;s eyes go wide with &#8220;yes. this.&#8221;</p>\n<p>There was something different about that story about a girl, not least because it was the first full-length novel I&#8217;d ever written. There was something about the story, something about the characters, that worked. I was thirteen, but I knew that. But I also knew something else &#8211; it wasn&#8217;t right. They weren&#8217;t the right words, and it wasn&#8217;t the right time.</p>\n<p>I tried revisiting the story and the girl several times over the next few years, but it never came together. I got better at writing. I read yet more books. I went to university, where writing came with grades and books were to be approached critically. I learned the difference between writing for someone else and writing for yourself.</p>\n<p>By the time I graduated, I had stopped writing stories. I went to work. I learned how to write professionally. How to fall asleep on a train in the morning and still get off at the right stop. The best time of the day to schedule tea breaks. The number of people who actually care about where to put apostrophes (depressingly few). How to write presentations. How to interview people.</p>\n<p>And all the time, I thought about that story of a girl. The story I&#8217;d never quite been able to tell. I thought about what she would be doing three, five, ten years in her own future. How many other people there were in her story. How they all had stories too. Her world grew. New characters appeared, one with a voice that felt right.</p>\n<p>A new protagonist. A new story of a girl. A feeling I&#8217;d never quite had before, of certainty.</p>\n<p>I wrote in the work canteen at lunchtimes and on the train home. I wrote in the ten minutes before the light turned off, then carried on write-dreaming until I fell asleep. I nestled into Starbucks sofas on the weekends. Conversations became scenes. Scenes became chapters. Soon it was 50,000 words. And then 80,000. And then it was finished.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m going to skim over what happened next, because the getting-an-agent process and everything after is too much to fit into a single blog. I&#8217;ll save it for another time, but suffice it to say it involves a lot of waiting. A lot of refreshing my inbox. A lot of nail-biting. And then all that agony forgotten in that one, perfect sentence: &#8220;Are you around next week to come in to my office and have a chat about <span class=\"il\">representation</span>?&#8221; (YES. YES I AM.)</p>\n<p>What follows: editing. Revising. A crash course in the world of publishing. More editing. A few tears. A few drafts. Submission. More agony.</p>\n<p>And then: &#8220;I would like to make an offer&#8230;&#8221;</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a funny thing, getting something you&#8217;ve always wanted. Realising a dream. It&#8217;s joyous and exhilarating, but it&#8217;s also scary. Like happiness vertigo. These characters who existed only in my head for over a decade now come up in conversation with people who have job titles like Senior Commissioning Editor. People I&#8217;ve never met know them better than they know <i>me.</i> They now have lives in the imaginations of <em>other people</em>. It&#8217;s wonderful. It&#8217;s terrifying.</p>\n<p>When I was thirteen, I wrote a story about a girl. And now that story is a book. A book that will have pages and a spine. A Goodreads page. Readers. Reviews. It took a long time to find the right words and the right time for them to come together, but now it has I wouldn&#8217;t have had it any other way.</p>\n<p>And so, the words I once only dreamed of being able to say: My debut novel, Beautiful Broken Things, will be published by Macmillan in Spring, 2016. And I am ecstatic.</p>\n",

She&#8217;s the director of content and community for Riot New Media, and works on one of our favorite literary sites, Book Riot. If that weren&#8217;t enough, she&#8217;s also one of our favorite people on Twitter.

(Presumably, drinking it as you read some more.)</span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">I’m a whiskey girl through and through. Most evenings, I can be found curled up with a whiskey ginger&#8211;whatever the bourbon of the moment is in my home bar + ginger ale. And because I’m a Real Southern Lady, I drink it in a Mason jar with a snoring hound dog at my feet.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><b>Can you tell us about your work with Book Riot? We’re huge fans of your content, and especially the Quarterly box!</b></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">My official title is Director of Content and Community Engagement. Which, well, that kind of says it all and also doesn’t tell you much. In the early days, it meant that I had a hand in everything, from the big picture to the tiniest details. These days, I work with the managing editors of our sites (Amanda Nelson at Book Riot and Paul Montgomery at Panels) to guide our content philosophy and planning, help oversee social media strategy, and do a whole bunch of other stuff.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">My job sits between the editorial side of the company and the operations side, so my days are a nice mix of creative work and practical/technical/business stuff. Projects like the Quarterly box and the new Book Riot Store live in the Venn diagram of those&#8211;they’re both creative and business-focused. I also co-host the weekly<span style=\"color:#800000;\"><a style=\"color:#800000;\" href=\"http://bookriot.com/category/podcast/\"> Book Riot Podcast </a></span>with Jeff O’Neal (the CEO of Riot New Media and Executive Editor of Book Riot and Panels), write a weekly column about my reading life called Inbox/Outbox, work on our YouTube channel, and, well, whatever else pops up. I joke that my job is totally different every six months, but it’s pretty true. We move fast and grow quickly, and there’s always something new to learn. It keeps me engaged and excited.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><a style=\"color:#000000;\" href=\"https://drunkausten.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/br_logo-copy.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-490\" src=\"https://drunkausten.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/br_logo-copy.jpg?w=300&#038;h=273\" alt=\"BR_Logo copy\" width=\"300\" height=\"273\" /></a></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><b>How did you end up working for Book Riot?</b></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">You know that saying “Luck favors the prepared”? (Is that a real saying, or did Usher make it up on <em>The Voice</em>? I’m not sure. But let’s go with it.) My career can be summed up by that. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">I had been blogging on my own for about 3 ½ years  and had made something of a name for myself when I started seeing buzz about a coming-soon site called Book Riot. I remember DMing the Book Riot Twitter account to ask who they were and what was up, and getting a super-mysterious answer. I had known Jeff online for a few years because of our blogs, and at some point, we started joking around on Twitter about writing something together about The Jersey Shore and books. He sent me a DM saying that he was one of the people launching Book Riot and asking if I’d be open to running the piece there. I said yes, then I started poking around Book Riot, and I saw that they were looking for a community manager. So I asked if the position was open, and then he and Clint Kabler (our COO) interviewed me, and then I started working part-time after the site’s first month.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">It was good timing, and I was lucky to have known Jeff for a while, but I won’t say it was all (or even nearly all) lucky. I’d been working hard on my blog, my relationships in publishing, and my social media skills for years. I wanted to make a leap, but I didn’t know exactly what I wanted to do. With Book Riot, I saw an opportunity, and I asked for it. I was lucky to see the opening, and I was lucky they said yes. I feel lucky every day that I get to work with such an awesome group of smart, passionate, funny, supportive, people who push me in a zillion ways.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><b>You’re uniquely suited in so many ways to comment on new media and the publishing industry. Do you think new media is the way of the future for the book industry? And for someone who wants to work with books and authors, what would you recommend to them?</b></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">You know, I love the internet. I really do. New media and social media have changed the conversation by giving all kinds of people&#8211;not just those with fancy educations and connections and conferred authority&#8211;the ability to share their opinions, have voices, and build audiences and communities. It’s incredible, and its impact on books and reading can’t be overstated. Readers who have never seen their favorite kinds of books in the pages of important newspapers don’t have to feel excluded, judged, or alone because they can come online and meet other people who are into the same books. The future of the book industry can’t help but be affected, and I think that’s a positive thing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">But the internet is still really young, and new media is *really* new, and we’re just beginning to see what they can do. So new media is part of the story for the future of books, but it’s not the whole story. People who work mostly offline&#8211;booksellers, librarians, agents, editors, etc.&#8211;are still helping drive the industry as well, and I think they’ll continue to be.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">For someone who wants to work with books and authors, well, there are a million possible ways to do that, and jobs that will exist 5 years from now that we haven’t thought of yet. Get involved in your literary community, whatever that means to you, and pay attention. Look for opportunities and ask for what you want when you see an opening. Do the work to get prepared, and then keep an eye out for the luck.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><b>One of your more unique jobs (I think, anyway) is deciding what goes into one of <span style=\"color:#800000;\"><a style=\"color:#800000;\" href=\"http://bookriot.com/2015/01/08/revealed-book-riots-fifth-quarterly-box-bkr05/\">Book Riot’s quarterly boxes</a></span>. Have you ever put anything in that you absolutely loved? What about something that was a surprise hit?</b></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Aside from the podcast, which is the best hour of every workweek, the Quarterly box is definitely my favorite project. All of the books in it have been books I love; that’s the perk of being the decider! I was really pleasantly surprised by the response to <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Rogue-Any-Other-Name-Scoundrels/dp/0062068520\"><i>A<span style=\"color:#800000;\"> Rogue by Any Other Name </span></i><span style=\"color:#800000;\">by Sarah MacLean</span></a>. It was in a box with a bunch of books &amp; items intended to help readers expand their horizons, and at first, we got a bunch of, “I’ll read anything but romance” messages. Then a few weeks later, they were followed up by a bunch of, “I tried the romance novel because Book Riot sent it to me, and I LOVED IT AND IT WAS AMAZING,” messages. That was so exciting and gratifying. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">People put their trust in us to recommend books to them, and that’s huge. Reading is so intensely personal. I take it seriously and always hope the Quarterly selections will be received in that light. Oh! And <span style=\"color:#800000;\"><a style=\"color:#800000;\" href=\"http://bookriot.com/2015/01/08/revealed-book-riots-fifth-quarterly-box-bkr05/\">we had a custom hat made for the winter box</a></span> that just says BOOKS across it. I knew people would dig it, but they’ve gone bonkers over it. So much fun.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><b>Similarly, you have some fabulous items for sale in the<span style=\"color:#800000;\"><a style=\"color:#800000;\" href=\"http://store.bookriot.com/\"> Book Riot store</a></span>, how do you choose what to sell? Is there anything you were surprised to see was a big seller?</b></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The guidepost we use for most things&#8211;the site, the store, the upcoming event&#8211;is “Is this the site/store/event we wants as book lovers?” So we choose items for the store that we and the Book Riot contributors love, and then I sit around thinking about what I want that hasn’t been made yet. We have a few original items to reveal soon that were born out of that impulse. No major surprises, but it’s been really great watching reactions as people have received their <a style=\"color:#000000;\" href=\"http://store.bookriot.com/collections/bookriot/products/book-riot-hoodie-gray\"><span style=\"color:#800000;\">Book Riot hoodies</span>.</a> They’re the coziest things ever.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><b>What kind of books did you read as a kid? Are there any fabulous YA books you love and would recommend?</b></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">I read anything I could get my hands on, and so many things that were too mature for me or went right over my head. I’m at the tail-end of Gen X (I just turned 32), and when I was growing up, YA wasn’t the big thing it is today. So I went from Baby-sitters Club and Fear Street books right into adult fiction. And adult fiction, for me, was whatever Oprah was recommending. Seriously! The internet didn’t exist yet, and school librarians certainly weren’t recommending grown-up books to precocious 14-year-olds, so I browsed bookstores and picked up Oprah selections. Oh, and Judy Blume. Of course, Judy Blume. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">My favorite YA author working today is <span style=\"color:#800000;\"><a style=\"color:#800000;\" href=\"https://twitter.com/as_king\">A.S. King</a></span>. I recommend all of her books, but I especially love her latest,<span style=\"color:#800000;\"> <a style=\"color:#800000;\" href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17453303-glory-o-brien-s-history-of-the-future\"><i>Glory O’Brien’s History of the Future</i>.</a></span> I’m deeply jealous of and happy for kids today who get to grow up reading amazing books that are written for them and their particular stage in life.<b><br />\n</b><b><br />\n</b><b>Is there any book you’ve read in particular that you credit with changing you somehow?

She gave voice to thoughts and feelings I had been simmering on for a while, and when I read her words, things just clicked. I had conversations about Major Life Stuff that I wouldn’t have had if not for this book, and I said things I wouldn’t have said otherwise. And those conversations changed the directions, in positive and important ways, of some of the defining relationships in my life.<a style=\"color:#000000;\" href=\"http://bookriot.com/2013/03/19/when-a-book-changes-your-life/\"><span style=\"color:#800000;\"> I wrote about it for Book Riot</span> </a>when I was in the throes a few years ago.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><b>Be honest: Do you sniff books?</b></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Nope!

What’s that going to be?</b></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Book Riot Live is a 2-day event in Manhattan later this year (November 7th and 8th). It’s going to be, basically, the book event we’ve all been wanting to go to. There will be panels, signings, games, live podcast recordings, parties, and who knows what else. I’ve been pitching it as “Imagine the website Book Riot comes to life, and you get to hang out in it.” We’ve just started working on the programming&#8211;headed up Jenn Northington, our new Director of Events and Programming (who also happens to be my best friend&#8230;see what I mean about lucky?), and it’s looking rad.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong><strong> </strong></strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><b>And you’re pulling double—triple—we’ve lost count by now—duty with your <span style=\"color:#800000;\"><a style=\"color:#800000;\" href=\"http://bookrageous.podbean.com/\">Bookrageous podcasts</a></span>. What is a typical Bookrageous show like? Tell us why should we tune in.</b></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Bookrageous is now my longest-running bookish project, since I’m no longer blogging on my own. It’s a show Jenn and our good friend Josh Christie decided to make in 2010, and I basically invited myself along. Last year, we asked Paul Montgomery and Preeti Chhibber to join the family. So! It’s a show about books and why they’re awesome. As we say in the intro, “We’re serious about books, but not exactly serious.” Each show begins with us talking about what we’re reading now, then we take on a theme or a game, or have an in-depth conversation about a title we’ve picked for our book club. It’s fun and silly and sweary (for a long time, we were the only book podcast to earn the iTunes “explicit” rating), and I’ve gotten more book recommendations from it than anywhere else in the last 4 ½ years. Bookrageous has expanded my horizons, challenged my ideas about books and reading, and introduced to me to countless favorites I might not have found on my own.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><b>Okay, speed round! </b><b><br />\n</b><b></b></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><b>Favorite fancy liquor: </b>Hmm.
